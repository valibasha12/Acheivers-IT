    <h1>Seven Wonders Of World</h1>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China"><img src="../Assets/images/pexels-sergei-a-1322276-2539417.jpg" alt="great wall of china" width="500px" height="300px"></a>
    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great wall of china</a></h1>
    <p>Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, 
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great Wall of China</a> is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed
        Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th 
        century BCE and continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually 
        features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches.In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the 
        bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza">Chichen Itza</a></h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza">Chichen Itza</a> is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and 10th
        centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of 
        important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo 
        (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ 
        astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar
         year. </p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra"><img src="../Assets/images/pexels-francesco-ungaro-15997882.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="300px"></a>
    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">Petra</a></h1>
    <p>The ancient city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">Petra</a>, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and 
        cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later 
        the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it flourished, becoming an 
        important trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, 
        and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a 
        water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming.</p>
    
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu"><img src="../Assets/images/pexels-jplenio-1423580.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="300px"></a>
    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu">Machu Picchu</a></h1>
    <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba,
         a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim 
         was later disproved, the purpose of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to 
         the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely
         a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat.One thing it apparently should not be is the
        site of a beer commercial.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)"><img src="../Assets/images/pexels-drethousand-8571271.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="300px"></a>
    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)">Christ the Redeemer</a></h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)">Christ the Redeemer</a>, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date
        to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was
        ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was
        completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its base, which is
        about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). </p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum"><img src="../Assets/images/pexels-chaitaastic-1797161.jpg" alt=""  width="500px" height="300px"></a>
    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a></h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the 
        amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable 
        of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though 
        men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> for mock naval 
        engagements. However, the belief that Christians were martyred there—namely, by being thrown to 
        lions—is debated.</p>
 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal"><img src="../Assets/images/pexels-maahidphotos-3881106.jpg" alt=""  width="500px" height="300px"></a>
    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a></h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, 
        India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan  to house the tomb of his beloved wife, 
        Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, 
        which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
        Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for 
        another five years. </p>
